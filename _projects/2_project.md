# Introduction

Advancing our understanding of cellular behaviour is pivotal in various
scientific domains, ranging from fundamental biology to applications in
medicine and tissue engineering. At UBC, my research focuses on
modelling cell behaviour using the established Cellular Potts Model
(CPM) formalism. The Morpheus software group's efforts have been
instrumental, enabling us to delve deeply into the biological
intricacies of cellular behaviour, with our emphasis on the biological
model itself rather than the framework.

This project aims to address a specific facet of cellular dynamics by
proposing a novel approach---an individual cell model structured with
springs and stimulated to protrude in a predefined direction guided by a
Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Such a focus allows for a more
nuanced exploration of the challenges inherent in creating computational
models that mirror the complex behaviour of individual cells and
discovering clever solutions using simple mathematical tools.

# Development

Throughout all stages of this project, the foundation is built upon the
formalism of the linear spring-mass model. Before delving into the
development, we will discuss how I implemented the model and some of the
characteristics of the parameters. The cell membrane will be represented
through point-mass objects connected by springs, defined for points $$i$$
and $$j$$ as follows: $$\begin{aligned}
    \delta_{ij} &= \frac{(x_i-x_j)}{\| x_i-x_j\|}\cdot(\frac{dx_i}{dt} - \frac{dxj}{dt})\\
    m_i\frac{d^2 x_i}{dt^2} &= -\frac{(x_i-x_j)}{\| x_i-x_j\|}[(k(\| x_i-x_j\| - r_{ss})+c\delta_{ij}] \\
\end{aligned}$$ Here, $$x_i$$ and $$x_j$$ are vectors in $$\mathbf{R}^2$$,
$$m_i$$ represents the mass of object $$i$$, $$k$$ denotes the spring
constant, $$c$$ is the damping coefficient, and $$r_{ss}$$ is the
equilibrium length of the spring. To apply the numerical method solvers
discussed in class, I converted this system into a first-order system:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \delta_{ij} &= \frac{(x_i-x_j)}{\| x_i-x_j\|}\cdot(v_j - v_i)\\
    \frac{d x_i}{dt} &= v_i\\
    \frac{d v_i}{dt} &= \frac{-1}{m_i}\frac{(x_i-x_j)}{\| x_i-x_j\|}[k(\| x_i-x_j\| - r_{ss}) +c\delta_{ij}]
\end{aligned}$$ Another crucial addition to the basics of this model was
the incorporation of a center point mass. The significance of this
central point is twofold: it prevents the cell from collapsing its
volume and becoming a straight line, while also introducing the concept
of internal cell pressure. The mass of this central node is set to be
the sum of all other nodes' masses. The springs connecting the center
point to the outer ones have their own constants and equilibrium sizes,
as they serve different functions than those mimicking the cell's
membrane. The challenge of volume collapse leads us to one of the major
problems I had to overcome with this model---tangling and collision of
the springs.

## Collision

The system begins to collapse in undesired and unrealistic ways when one
of the point masses passes through a spring. Here is a brief schematic
illustrating how this occurs:

<figure id="col">
<figure>
<img src="collision_tn.jpeg" />
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="collision_tn1.jpeg" />
</figure>
<figcaption>Here the purple point-mass crosses the spring connecting the
red and blue dot</figcaption>
</figure>

To address this issue, I need to develop a function that can perform two
tasks: identify collisions and resolve them.

### Potential Collisions

Firstly, the code must identify potential collisions before they occur,
allowing us to compare frames and detect collisions. Computing all point
masses against every outer spring can be computationally expensive,
especially with a high number of point masses. To mitigate this, each
point is checked to determine if it lies within the smallest rectangle
that the spring occupies.

Consider a spring connecting points $$i$$ and $$j$$ with positions
$$(x_i, y_i)$$ and $$(x_j, y_j)$$. Without loss of generality, let
$$x_i < x_j$$ and $$y_i < y_j$$. Then, a point $$k$$ is considered for
collision checking with the spring connecting $$i$$ and $$j$$ if
$$x_i < x_k < x_j$$ and $$y_i < y_k < y_j$$.

### Identifying Collisions

After storing the points of potential collisions, a collision checker
must traverse through two points in time (previous and current) and
return a Boolean variable indicating whether a collision occurred. Since
this problem is not continuous, we need an algorithm that can gather
information from both frames and compare them. To achieve this, I will
compute a coordinate change on both frames, bringing the $$x$$-axis to the
spring ($$x'$$), and the $$y$$-axis will be the normal vector of the spring
($$y'$$). The matrix for such coordinate change in the frame number $$n$$ is
given as follows: $$\begin{aligned}
    A_n&=\begin{bmatrix}
    x_j-x_i & -(y_j-y_i) \\
    y_j-y_i & x_j-x_i 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}$$

One may observe that this is essentially a rotation matrix. Although
simplifications can be made to express the matrix in terms of the angle
that the spring makes, I opted not to pursue this approach due to the
additional computation it would entail.

It's important to note that as the spring itself is in motion, the
rotation matrix will also vary from frame to frame. With this coordinate
change setup, we can transform the coordinates of the potential
collision. A collision is detected when the new y-coordinate changes
sign.

<figcaption>The same collision as discussed in <a href="#col"
data-reference-type="ref+label" data-reference="col">1</a> is presented
here, along with a representation of the new axis after the coordinate
change. This visualization helps illustrate why a shift in the sign of
the new <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> coordinate would
signify a collisionâ€”indicating a crossing of the new <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis, which corresponds to the
spring.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Collision Solver

In this section, I will employ the concept of continuous collision to
simulate a perfect elastic collision between the point mass and the
spring. An assumption is made that the spring has infinite mass compared
to the point mass, treating the spring as if it were a wall.

The underlying idea of this algorithm is that upon confirming a
collision between frames $$n$$ and $$n+1$$, we can generate a parameterized
curve from the position of point $$k$$ in frame $$n$$---denoted as
$$p_k(n)$$---to its position in the subsequent frame. This curve is
expressed in another variable $$s$$, where $$s \in [0,1]$$, defined as
follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
    u(s) &= [p_k(n+1)]s + [p_k(n)](1-s)
\end{aligned}$$

<figure id="colcts">
<figure>
<img src="collisioncts.jpeg" />
</figure>
<figcaption>Continuous collision</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, considering that the point will rebound from the spring, in the
spring coordinate system, this corresponds to a change of sign for the
new $$y$$-axis. Since there is also a shift in velocity, we will take the
change in velocity into account as well, denoted as $$v_k(n)$$. In the
spring coordinate system, $$p_k(n+1)$$ becomes: $$\begin{aligned}
    (A_{n+1})^{-1}p_k(n+1) &= \left[\begin{array}{rr}
                   -\frac{\left(-x_{j}+x_{i}\right) x_{k}\! \left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}}-\frac{\left(-y_{j}+y_{i}\right) y_{k}\! \left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}} \\
                   \frac{\left(-y_{j}+y_{i}\right) x_{k}\! \left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}}-\frac{\left(-x_{j}+x_{i}\right) y_{k}\! \left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}} \\
                \end{array} \right] \\               
\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, to compute the new position -- $$p'_k(n+1)$$ --
we will do: $$\begin{aligned}
    p'_k(n+1) &= (A_{n+1})\begin{bmatrix}
                   -\frac{\left(-x_{j}+x_{i}\right) x_{k}\left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}}-\frac{\left(-y_{j}+y_{i}\right) y_{k}\left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}}  \\
                    -\frac{\left(-y_{j}+y_{i}\right) x_{k}\left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}}+\frac{\left(-x_{j}+x_{i}\right) y_{k}\left(n+1\right)}{x_{i}^{2}-2 x_{j} x_{i}+x_{j}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}-2 y_{j} y_{i}+y_{j}^{2}}  \\
                \end{bmatrix} \\
                \\              
\end{aligned}$$ Use the above as the new position and velocity for the
point $$k$$ and continue with the simulation.

# Rac-Based Protrusion

The model central to my research revolves around the Rac-based
protrusion of white blood cells. Rac is a protein that functions akin to
a switch inside the cell. When in the \"on\" state, it is activated and
binds to the cell's membrane, exhibiting a low diffusion rate. In its
inactive state, Rac freely moves within the cell's cytoplasm, suggesting
a high diffusion rate in its availability around the cell's membrane.
The accumulation of active Rac in local high-density regions is
sustained through a positive feedback loop. Simultaneously, it produces
a local inhibitor, which operates on a much slower time scale and
diffusion rate.

Under normal circumstances, Rac activation is facilitated by a chemical
gradient left by bacteria. Upon activation and binding to the cell
membrane, Rac promotes cellular protrusion, aiding white blood cells in
moving toward bacteria. However, quantifying these experiments in a
laboratory setting poses challenges, prompting the collaborative efforts
of Orion Weiner and Jason Town from UCSF, now partners in our research
group. They successfully modified white blood cells to respond to light
stimulation, allowing them to gather quantitative data on Rac
production.

The partial differential equation (PDE) model that encapsulates their
experiments is defined in periodic boundaries around the cell membrane
in 1D:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} &= B\left(k_0 + 0.2U + \gamma \frac{A^n}{K^n + A^n}\right) - \left(\delta+0.4H\right) A + D_A \frac{\partial ^2A}{\partial x^2} \\
    \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} &= -B\left(k_0 + 0.2U + \gamma \frac{A^n}{K^n + A^n}\right) + \left(\delta+0.4H\right) A + D_A \frac{\partial ^2A}{\partial x^2} \\
    \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} &= \epsilon\left(\alpha A - \delta_h H \right)+ D_H \frac{\partial ^2H}{\partial x^2} \\
\end{aligned}$$

**Variable - $$A$$:** Active form of the protein around the membrane.
Initialized with random values. Its diffusion rate is low to promote
wave-pinning behaviour. Initiated as $$1.5 +$$ rand_uni$$(-0.1,0.1)$$ across
space.

**Variable - $$B$$:** Inactive form of the protein around the membrane.
Has a higher diffusion rate than A. Acts as a global inhibitor.
Initiated as $$0.8$$ across space.

**Variable - $$U$$:** The light stimulus around the cell. Initialized at
0, and it changes to 0.05 in specified regions of the 1-d space.

**Variable - $$H$$:** Local Rac inhibitor, slow time scale and low
diffusion rate. Initiated as 0

**Constant - $$k_0:$$** Basal activation of the protein. Value = $$0.067$$.

**Constant - $$\gamma:$$** Rate of positive feedback of active protein.
Value = $$1$$.

**Constant - $$\epsilon:$$** Time scale ratio between Rac's dynamic and
the local Rac inhibitor. Value = $$0.05$$.

**Constant - $$\delta:$$** Basal inactivation of the protein. Value = $$1$$.

**Constant - $$\delta_H:$$** Basal decay of the local Rac inhibitor. Value
= $$0.4$$.

**Constant - $$\alpha:$$** Activation of local inhibitor promoted by
active protein. Value = $$0.1$$.

**Constant - $$K:$$** Threshold for positive feedback for wave pinning.
Value = $$1$$.

**Constant - $$n:$$** Hill function coefficient. Value = $$2$$.

**Constant - $$D_A:$$** Diffusion rate of active protein. Value =
$$0.05*\left(\frac{3}{2\pi}\right)^2$$.

**Constant - $$D_B:$$** Diffusion rate of inactive protein. Value =
$$10*\left(\frac{3}{2\pi}\right)^2$$.

**Constant - $$D_H:$$** Diffusion rate of local inhibitor. Value =
$$0.001*\left(\frac{3}{2\pi}\right)^2$$.\
With periodic boundaries, the anticipated outcome is the generation of
travelling wave solutions. However, the introduction of a local light
stimulus allows us to trap that moving wave. The term
$$\left(\frac{3}{2\pi}\right)^2$$ serves as a space-scaling factor to
align with the parameter regime I work with, yielding comparable
results.

# Implementation of PDE

The concept is to run the partial differential equation (PDE) in a unit
circle centred at the cell. I define the center as the average of all
outer point positions and then project the PDE values onto the outer
point-mass objects. If a certain threshold is met, that node protrudes
outward in proportion to the active protein. Since, in this model, the
cell's state (size, shape, velocity) does not affect the protein
dynamics, I precompute the PDE results and use them while solving the
spring-mass ordinary differential equation (ODE) system.

## Method of Lines

To rephrase this problem in a format convenient for the methods learned
or mentioned, I discretize space into equispaced points ($$N$$ = 100) and
maintain all variables as a single vector named $$R$$. This yields the
following method of lines:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{dt}R &= f(R) + \frac{D}{h^2}R \\
    R = \left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrrr}
           A_1\\
           A_2 \\
           \vdots \\
           A_N \\
           B_1\\
           B_2\\
           \vdots \\
           B_N \\
           H_1 \\
           H_2 \\
           \vdots \\
           H_N
    \end{array}\right] ,
    f(R) &= \left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrrr}
           B_1\left(k_0 + 0.2U_1 + \gamma \frac{A_1^n}{K^n + A_1^n}\right) - \left(\delta+0.4H_1\right) A_1\\
            B_2\left(k_0 + 0.2U_2 + \gamma \frac{A_2^n}{K^n + A_2^n}\right) - \left(\delta+0.4H_2\right) A_2\\
           \vdots \\
            B_N\left(k_0 + 0.2U_N + \gamma \frac{A_N^n}{K^n + A_N^n}\right) - \left(\delta+0.4H_N\right) A_N\\
            -B_1\left(k_0 + 0.2U_1 + \gamma \frac{A_1^n}{K^n + A_1^n}\right) + \left(\delta+0.4H_1\right) A_1\\
           -B_2\left(k_0 + 0.2U_2 + \gamma \frac{A_2^n}{K^n + A_2^n}\right) + \left(\delta+0.4H_2\right) A_2\\
           \vdots \\
          -B_N\left(k_0 + 0.2U_N + \gamma \frac{A_N^n}{K^n + A_N^n}\right) + \left(\delta+0.4H_N\right) A_N\\
           \epsilon\left(\alpha A_1 - \delta_h H_1 \right) \\
           \epsilon\left(\alpha A_2 - \delta_h H_2 \right) \\
           \vdots \\
           \epsilon\left(\alpha A_N - \delta_h H_N \right)
    \end{array}\right] \\
    L = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
        -2 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 1 \\
        1 & -2 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & -2 & \dots & 0 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots &\vdots \\
        1 & 0 & \dots & 1 & -2 
    \end{array} \right], 
    D &= \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
        D_AL & & \makebox(0,0){\text{\huge 0}}\\
             &D_BL & \\
        \makebox(0,0){\text{\huge 0}}&  &D_H L
    \end{array}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

## SBDF-2

To obtain an approximate solution $$R(t)$$, we will employ the SBDF-2
method, as it has been recommended for reaction-diffusion models, and
this problem bears resemblance to such models. For a single time step,
we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
    R^{n+1} = \frac{4}{3}R^n-\frac{1}{3}R^{n-1}+\frac{2\Delta t}{3}\left(\frac{D}{h^2} \right)R^{n+1}+\frac{4\Delta t}{3}f(R^n)-\frac{2\Delta t}{3}f(R^{n-1})
\end{aligned}$$ Which simplifies to: $$\begin{aligned}
    R^{n+1} = \left(I_{3N}-\frac{2\Delta t}{3}\left(\frac{D}{h^2} \right)\right)^{-1}\left[\frac{4}{3}R^n-\frac{1}{3}R^{n-1}+\frac{4\Delta t}{3}f(R^n)-\frac{2\Delta t}{3}f(R^{n-1})\right]
\end{aligned}$$ Since this problem relies on having an initial condition
and a step after it, I will use forward Euler to get this extra step.
$$\begin{aligned}
    R^1 = R^0 + \Delta t \left(f(R^0) + \frac{D}{h^2}R^0\right)
\end{aligned}$$

for <span class="math inline"><em>t</em>â€„âˆˆâ€„[0,500]</span> which will be
still scaled to match the time-scale of the cell model.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, armed with data on how the partial differential equation (PDE)
dynamics evolve, we need to derive an algorithm to assign the PDE values
to the nodes at the cell's membrane and the center node. This
implementation will be integrated into the code governing the
spring-mass system, where Rac promotes protrusions, acting as a velocity
vector.

## Time Scaling and Projection

Given that the PDE operates on a different time scale than the
spring-mass system, a uniform mapping was performed to align the end of
the simulation with the end of the Rac data.

Within the spring-mass system, we assume that Rac influences the rate of
change of position, essentially acting as a velocity vector. To map the
locations of the outer nodes to the PDE space, we first determine the
center of the cell by averaging the locations of all nodes (excluding
the center node) and denote them as $$x_c$$ and $$y_c$$. After shifting the
center to the origin, we compute the $$\theta$$ value of each node's
position.

To map their $$\theta$$ to the PDE space $$x$$, we calculate what index of
$$x$$ produces the $$min(x - \theta)$$. Subtracting $$\theta$$ element-wise
from $$x$$, the minimum value serves as the best approximation for
$$\theta$$ in $$x$$, similar to how real numbers are mapped to
floating-point representations. Now we can extract the relevant PDE data
for each node.

## Protrusion Vector Field

The core concept behind the protrusion is to function like air pressure
in a balloon---an outward force radiating from the center towards the
periphery. Unlike air pressure, this force is more robust, or active, in
regions with high Rac activation. The vector field is expressed as
follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
    P &= \left[\begin{array}{rr}
        -1.5 R(\theta)*(R(\theta)>0.4)*\frac{x-x_c}{\sqrt{(x - x_c)^2+(y - y_c)^2}} \\
        -1.5 R(\theta)*(R(\theta)>0.4)*\frac{y-y_c}{\sqrt{(x - x_c)^2+(y - y_c)^2}}
    \end{array} \right]
\end{aligned}$$

Here, we leverage the Boolean function $$(R(\theta)>0.4)$$ to construct a
piece-wise vector field. This velocity is then integrated into the rate
of change of the position of the nodes, inducing protrusion. The center
node moves slightly differently to prevent constant changes if the same
method is applied.

The center node moves in the direction of the outer node with the
highest active Rac value, proportionally to the Rac activation in that
area.

# Final Results

Now, everything is constructed. We have a spring-mass system ensuring
connectivity of the cell parts, a collision detector and solver
preventing spring entanglement, and finally, a partial differential
equation describing the internal mechanisms causing cell protrusion.
Putting it all together, we obtain the following:

# Discussion

When comparing these results to my simulations in CPM, we observe
qualitatively similar behaviours in terms of protrusion. However, the
simplicity of the spring-mass model consistently yields a circular cell
shape, regardless of protrusion. I've explored adjusting the spring
parameters to achieve what we refer to as \"aspherity.\" The aspherity
of a given shape quantifies how close it is to a perfect circle by
comparing the perimeter to the volume. More malleable cells exhibit \"a
lot of perimeters for not so much volume,\" giving them a more
liquid-like behaviour. Attempting the same adjustments here results in
undesired entanglement, revealing a limitation of the collision solver,
particularly when dealing with multiple collisions simultaneously.
Perhaps a valuable improvement would be to assign a radius of collision
instead of treating nodes as mere points with no area. One of these
attempts is depicted below:

# Conclusion

As mentioned in the introduction, the primary objective of this project
was not to develop a replacement for the formalisms used in my research.
Instead, it aimed to illustrate how we continually stand on the
shoulders of giants in scientific endeavours. Working with this
simplified version has deepened my appreciation for the contributions of
the Morpheus development team and enhanced my understanding of the
complexities involved in creating a multi-scale model. The code,
well-documented and accessible, is provided in the appendix link.
Everything presented here was implemented in Matlab; I also tested it in
Linux Octave, with the only exception being the video writer feature,
which may not work.

    velocity and position. This is the $$f(u)$$ function of the RK4
    method.

-   *getLines.m* - Gets information from the position and indexation of
    the nodes and creates objects that contain information about each
    spring.

-   *collision.m* - Where collisions between nodes and springs are
    detected and solved.

-   *plot_cell.m* - Plots the simulation and saves a *.mp4* animation.

-   *plot_cell_control.m* - Used to plot frames while doing debugging
    and testing. Works similarly to the above, but it has fewer features
    and is less automated.

-   *Spring.m* - Code developed Xue-She Wang (2023), I found it online
    through the Matlab website.

-   *optorac.m* - Runs Rac simulation and saves the data. Cannot run
    this together with the rest without running out of memory.
