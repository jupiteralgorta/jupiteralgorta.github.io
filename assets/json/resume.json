Collaborating with esteemed researchers Jason Town and Orion Weiner (USFC), I have been fortunate to access extensive quantitative data that fortifies their hypothesis regarding the existence of this inhibitor. Leveraging this valuable dataset and building upon prior work in adaptive systems, I am actively engaged in constructing a spatial computational model encapsulating Rac activity within a moving cell, incorporating the hypothesized inhibitor.",
