I find joy in being the physicist of biology, where the intricate dance of biological systems meets the precision of mathematical modeling. From envisioning springs and forces to understanding the subtleties of inertia, I thrive on translating these physical concepts into the dynamic world of biology.

## Hobbies
When not immersed in the world of mathematical intricacies, you can find me indulging in the simplicity of life. Whether it's engaging in spirited game nights with friends, spending afternoons immersed in the warm sounds of vinyl records, or practicing my musical prowess on drums, piano, and guitar, I believe in the harmonious balance of work and play. And yes, you might catch me belting out tunes in a karaoke bar – it's a Brazilian mathematician's way of unwinding!

## Research Focus
Currently, my passion lies in unraveling the mysteries of neutrophil motility through mathematical modeling. Each project is a testament to my dream-come-true journey, and I take pride in the multitude of accomplishments that are blossoming along the way.

## Collaboration Approach
My academic philosophy is rooted in openness and accessibility. I welcome collaboration with open arms and firmly believe that knowledge should be shared freely. All my research work is a public treasure, accessible to anyone with an interest in exploring the fascinating intersections of mathematics and biology.

## Message to You
I am not just a mathematician; I am a chill Brazilian mind navigating the complexities of academia. Whether delving into the depths of scientific inquiry or unwinding with friends, I bring both nerdy enthusiasm and a laid-back vibe to this extraordinary journey.

Feel free to explore my academic endeavors on this platform. Let's connect, collaborate, and enjoy the beauty of mathematical biology – with a touch of Brazilian warmth and passion!
