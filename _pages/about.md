## Welcome to My Academic Corner!

I'm Jupiter Algorta, a Brazilian mathematician living my dream in the vibrant world of Mathematical Biology. Currently unraveling the mysteries of neutrophil motility through mathematical modeling, I bring a unique blend of precision and passion to the intersection of biology and mathematics.

In this website I will be posting my main and side projects, together with tutorials I may record. Please dont hesitate on contactingme via e-mail if you have any questions or interest in talking about anything you find here.
